## What?
ComputerCraft is the first mod that I have ever used and also one of my favorite mods.
The only problem I have with is... the old textures so I manually am fixing and tweaking them along with some other things.

## Known Issues
Main Known issue
* Mods that add blocks that can be used as peripherals for CC:T On forge, dont work with CC:R.
	* This is because of the differences between forge and fabric, and that mod devs, to my knowledge have not agreed upon a standard method in which to implement cross compatibility between mods,

## Known Working mods that add Peripherals
* Please let me know of other mods that work with this one
	* Better End
	* Better Nether
