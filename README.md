## Known Issues
Main Known issue
* Mods that add blocks that can be used as peripherals for CC:T On forge, dont work with CC:R.
	* This is because of the differences between forge and fabric, and that mod devs, to my knowledge have not agreed upon a standard method in which to implement cross compatibility between mods,

## Known Working mods that add Peripherals

# ![CC: ReTweaked](logo.png)
CC: ReTweaked is a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork/port of an update /port /fork of [ComputerCraft](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft), adding programmable computers,
turtles and more to Minecraft.

## What?
ComputerCraft has always held a fond place in my heart: it's the mod which really got me into mods, and it's the
mod which has kept me playing it for many years. However, development of the original mod has slowed, as the original
developers have had less time to work on the mod, and moved onto other projects and commitments.

CC: ReTweaked (or CC:Rt for short) is an attempt to continue ComputerCraft's legacy. It's not intended to be a competitor
to CC, nor do I want to take it in a vastly different direction to the original mod. Instead, CC:T focuses on making the
ComputerCraft experience as _solid_ as possible, ironing out any wrinkles that may have developed over time.
