# Just my list of things I have ported over

Format for the changelog of ported stuff
```
commit    // Shows commit from CC:T
commit2   // Shows a commit that is the same thing, just a clean up, only if right after
Title     // Commit Title
SubScript // Desc of commit
```

If a edit that is present in CC:T is not needed, I will skip over it.
Any and all references to an issue number, are to be found on CC:T's repo. 

Any commit that starts with `[Patchwork]` are purely edits made by my hand, and not based on other commits from CC:T, this is to help differentiate my changes from the official changes

Lines that are found above a commit in this log like this one, (excluding this one) are comments about how i had to implement things that are not a simple 1:1 (excluding fabric/forge differences) conversion

HTTP rules now allow filtering by port

The HTTP filtering system becomes even more complex! Though in this
case, it's pretty minimal, and definitely worth doing.

For instance, the following rule will allow connecting to localhost on
port :8080.

    [[http.rules]]
    host = "127.0.0.1"
    port = 8080
    action = "allow"

    # Other rules as before.

Closes #540

Don't propagate adjacent redstone signals for computers (#549)

Minecraft propagates "strong" redstone signals (such as those directly
from comparators or repeaters) through solid blocks. This includes
computers, which is a little annoying as it means one cannot feed
redstone wire from one side and a repeater from another.

This changes computers to not propagate strong redstone signals, in the
same way transparent blocks like glass do.

Closes #548.

Make generic peripherals on by default

This is a long way away from "feature complete" as it were. However,
it's definitely at a point where it's suitable for general usage - I'm
happy with the API, and don't think I'm going to be breaking things any
time soon.

That said, things aren't exposed yet for Java-side public consumption. I
was kinda waiting until working on Plethora to actually do that, but not
sure if/when that'll happen.

If someone else wants to work on an integration mod (or just adding
integrations for their own mod), do get in touch and I can work out how
to expose this.

Closes #452

Fix players not getting advancements when they own turtles

When we construct a new ServerPlayerEntity (and thus TurtlePlayer), we
get the current (global) advancement state and call .setPlayer() on it.

As grantCriterion blocks FakePlayers from getting advancements, this
means a player will no longer receive any advancements, as the "wrong"
player object is being consulted.

As a temporary work around, we attempt to restore the previous player to
the advancement store. I'll try to upstream something into Forge to
resolve this properly.

Fixes #564

Auto-generate monitor models

I didn't think it was worth it, and then I found myself needing to

so that's fine.

Also fixes several issues with us using the wrong texture (closes #572).

little more detail.

d4199064ae5ae8023c589f80f12d94e1c6bbc2b5

Make fs.combine accept multiple arguments

Means we can now do fs.combine("a", "b", "c"). Of course, one may just
write "a/b/c" in this case, but it's definitely useful elsewhere.

This is /technically/ a breaking change as fs.combine(a, b:gsub(...))
will no longer function (as gsub returns multiple arguments). However,
I've done a quick search through GH and my Pastebin archives and can't
find any programs which would break. Fingers crossed.
