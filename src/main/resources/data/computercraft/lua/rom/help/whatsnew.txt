New features in CC: Restitched 1.95.0

* Optimise the paint program's initial render.
* Several documentation improvments (Gibbo3771, MCJack123).
* `fs.combine` now accepts multiple arguments.
* Add a setting (`bios.strict_globals`) to error when accidentally declaring a global. (Lupus590).
* Add an improved help viewer which allows scrolling up and down (MCJack123).
* Add `cc.strings` module, with utilities for wrapping text (Lupus590).
* The `clear` program now allows resetting the palette too (Luca0208).

And several bug fixes:
* Fix memory leak in generic peripherals.
* Fix crash when a turtle is broken while being ticked.
* `textutils.*tabulate` now accepts strings _or_ numbers.
* We now deny _all_ local IPs, using the magic `$private` host. Previously the IPv6 loopback interface was not blocked.
* Fix crash when rendering monitors if the block has not yet been synced. You will need to regenerate the config file to apply this change.
* `read` now supports numpad enter (TheWireLord)
* Correctly handle HTTP redirects to URLs containing escape characters.
* Fix integer overflow in `os.epoch`.
* Allow using pickaxes (and other items) for turtle upgrades which have mod-specific NBT.
* Fix duplicate turtle/pocket upgrade recipes appearing in JEI.
