/**
 * Keeps track of tasks that a {@link Computer} should run on the main thread and how long that has been spent executing them.
 *
 * This provides rate-limiting mechanism for tasks enqueued with {@link Computer#queueMainThread(Runnable)}, but also those run elsewhere (such as during
 * the turtle's tick - see {@link TurtleBrain#update()}). In order to handle this, the executor goes through three stages:
 *
 * When {@link State#COOL}, the computer is allocated {@link ComputerCraft#maxMainComputerTime}ns to execute any work this tick. At the beginning of the
 * tick, we execute as many {@link MainThread} tasks as possible, until our time-frame or the global time frame has expired.
 *
 * Then, when other objects (such as {@link TileEntity}) are ticked, we update how much time we've used using {@link IWorkMonitor#trackWork(long,
 * TimeUnit)}.
 *
 * Now, if anywhere during this period, we use more than our allocated time slice, the executor is marked as {@link State#HOT}. This means it will no longer
 * be able to execute {@link MainThread} tasks (though will still execute tile entity tasks, in order to prevent the main thread from exhausting work every
 * tick).
 *
 * At the beginning of the next tick, we increment the budget e by {@link ComputerCraft#maxMainComputerTime} and any {@link State#HOT} executors are marked
 * as {@link State#COOLING}. They will remain cooling until their budget is fully replenished (is equal to {@link ComputerCraft#maxMainComputerTime}). Note,
 * this is different to {@link MainThread}, which allows running when it has any budget left. When cooling, <em>no</em> tasks are executed - be they on the
 * tile entity or main thread.
 *
 * This mechanism means that, on average, computers will use at most {@link ComputerCraft#maxMainComputerTime}ns per second, but one task source will not
 * prevent others from executing.
 *

 * @see IWorkMonitor
 * @see Computer#getMainThreadMonitor()
